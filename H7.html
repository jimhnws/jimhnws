    <p>Veil covering the whole sky, sometimes a halo around the sun or
        moon is present<br><br>

        Once cirrostratus has finished “invading” the sky, it is referred
        as a veil of high clouds. Generally, the cirrostratus is thin enough
        to allow sunshine or moonshine to be visible, but if it continues to
        thicken, it can become opaque to obscure the entire sky.<br><br>

        A cirrostratus veil often marks a process in which the moisture
        throughout the atmosphere is increasing, and it is not unusual for
        altostratus to begin to appear shortly after the cirrostratus covers
        the entire sky. During the cool season (October through April),
        cirrostratus can be indicative of steady precipitation with 24 hours,
        but during the warm season, it is not definite the rain follows cirrostratus.<br><br>

        The cirrostratus in this image (taken in Moosic, PA) became thick enough to
        cut off the sunshine that was driving cumulus development by early afternoon.<br><br>
